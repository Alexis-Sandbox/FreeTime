== Introduction

Timetable Deconflicter (TBC) is a desktop app that allows you to *find free timeslots to meet team members for projects*. More specifically, it helps you identify the times during which everyone you want to meet is free. Timetable Deconflicter is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
